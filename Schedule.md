- [X] Functional dependencies (6.2.3)
- [X] Full or Irreducible functional dependencies

### Homework due Thus. 2/21
* Submit queries that check for Functional dependencies in `sf-salaries`
* For each functional dep. found, determine if it's full (aka irreducible)

- [x] More BCNF
- [x] `CREATE TABLE` and `CREATE VIEW`

### Homework due 3/7
* submit to your homework repository queries to split the `Salaries` table of `sf-salaries` into BCNF. You should be able to turn `Salaries` into 4 tables somewhat easily even if you can't get complete BCNF.

## Tues. 3/5
- [ ] Quiz 2 on Functional Dependencies and NF 1-BC
- [ ] MVD and 4 NF

### HW
 * continue BCNF normalization of `sf-salaries`
